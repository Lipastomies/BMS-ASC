## Dependencies
The controller uses [NicoHood's HID library](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID) for Arduino.

## Usage
This repository includes the design files for the physical controller and the code for the Arduino Leo development board. Build instructions in the wiki. This repository does NOT include any sort of game or other playable content, it only contains the means of building a controller. 

## Controller Overview
This is a BMS video game controller. BMS gameplay consists of the player hitting keys and turning a turntable according to the notes the game presents. This controller is designed to be semi-accurate to its arcade counterpart (Beatmania IIDX series by Konami). It has most features that commercial examples do, like many input options, reversible design and arcade-accurate(ish) dimensions. More information in the wiki.
